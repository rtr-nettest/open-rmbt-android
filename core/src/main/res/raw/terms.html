<h1>1. Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>The RTR-NetTest app can be used only after explicit consent to RTR’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use for the
    RTR-NetTest. Note that the IP address is transferred, among others also to third countries (thus outside of the EU
    and the EEA) for which neither an adequacy decision nor appropriate safeguards exist. For further details see items
    1.2.1.3. and 1.2.2.3.</p>
<h2>1.1. General </h2>
<p>RTR offers users the opportunity to use the RTR-NetTest. Under 14 years can use the RTR-NetTest with the consent of
    their legal guardian. RTR’s legal authorisation to offer the RTR-NetTest is enshrined in&nbsp;<a

            class="external-link">Art. &nbsp;17 Par.&nbsp;4 and Par.&nbsp;5 Telecommunications Act 2003</a> as well as <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32015R2120"
                                                                                                                     title="Link to TSM Regulation" target="_blank"
                                                                                                                     class="external-link">Art 5 Par. 1 Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 ("TSM regulation")</a>. To fulfil this duty and ensure users with the greatest
    possible transparency and information – while respecting their privacy – the RTR-NetTest is based on the open source
    and open data principle.</p>
<p>The RTR-NetTest comprises two independent test sets: the first is a test developed by RTR (= RTR Multithreaded
    Broadband Test, hereafter the <strong>RMB-Test</strong>); the second is an <strong>optional</strong>, more
    comprehensive test (= Network Diagnostic Tool test of the M-Lab research platform, <strong>NDT-Test</strong>).</p>
<h2>1.2. Processing of data by the RMB-Test and by the optional NDT-Test</h2>
<h3>1.2.1. RMB-Test</h3>

    for information, use, dissemination and other applications.</p>
<h4><strong>1.2.1.2. Processing of personal data and the purposes for processing of personal data </strong></h4>
<p>Only with the solely agreement of the user the following personal data are processed in the course of the RMB-Test:
    (1) the <strong>Client UUID</strong>, (2) the <strong>WLAN network ID (SSID) and numerical WLAN ID (BSSID)</strong>
    as well as (3) the <strong>IP address</strong>.</p>
<p>Purposes for processing these personal data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>in respect to the <strong>Client UUID</strong>: possibility of compiling a test result history for the user;
        identifying associated tests to identify improper use or malfunctions; Percipience of the rights of the uses
        according to item 1.4.
    </li>
    <li>in respect to the <strong>WLAN network ID (SSID)</strong> and <strong>numerical WLAN ID (BSSID)</strong>:
        presentation in the user’s history; identifying associated tests to identify improper use or malfunctions.
    </li>
    <li>in respect to the <strong>IP address</strong>: Technical enabling of the RTR-NetTest and ensuring the full
        functionality, in particular display of the map and quality measurements; in order to be able to assign the
        tests to individual operators (via routing information [AS] or host names); detection of improper use or
        malfunctions.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>1.2.1.3. Transferring of personal data</strong></h4>
<p>The IP address is transferred, among others also to <strong>third countries</strong>:<strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>within the EU and the EEA</strong>: Depending on the used website and terminal, for the representation
        of the maps and for position determination, map data from basemap.at (<a href="https://basemap.at"
                                                                                 target="_blank"
                                                                                 rel="noopener noreferrer">https://basemap.at</a>)
        and OpenStreetMap (<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.openstreetmap.org</a>)
        are retrieved.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Third countries</strong>: In order to conduct DNS tests as part of the quality tests, DNS requests are
        sent to public DNS servers of Google (<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank"
                                                 rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.google.com</a>), Cloudflare (<a
                href="https://www.cloudflare.com" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cloudflare.com</a>) and Quad9 (<a href="https://www.quad9.net"
                                                                                        target="_blank"
                                                                                        rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.quad9.net</a>).
        Depending on the used website and terminal, for the representation of the maps and for position determination,
        map data from Google (<a href="https://www.google.at" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.google.at</a>)
        und Microsoft (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.microsoft.com</a>)
        are retrieved.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The transfer of data to Google, Cloudflare and Microsoft is based on adequacy decisions of the Commission - according
    to Art 45 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Regarding Quad9 neither an adequacy decisions nor appropriate
    safeguards according to Art 46 GDPR exist. A possible risk of such a transfer is that the IP address of the user is
    transferred to Quad9 and thus conclusions on the executing of the RTR-NetTest may be drawn.</p>
<h3>1.2.2. Optional NDT-Test</h3>
<p>The NDT-Test is only run if, after accepting the privacy policy and terms of use of the RTR-NetTest, the checkbox “I
    wish to run the optional, more comprehensive NDT-Test“ is selected. The user explicitly accepts that for the
    NDT-Test the <strong>IP address </strong><strong>is</strong> <strong>processed and transferred to a third country as
        well that the IP address is published</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>1.2.2.1. What data are processed?</strong></h4>
<p>The following data are processed as part of the <strong>NDT-Test</strong>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>speed of data connection in both directions (downlink/uplink);</li>
    <li>TCP/IP protocol parameters (e.g. TCP receive window);</li>
    <li>proportion of IP packet losses, connection errors (e.g. half duplex);</li>
    <li>latency/jitter of data connection (ping);</li>
    <li>test parameters (test method, test server, test configuration);</li>
    <li>operating system (name/version) and processor architecture;</li>
    <li>Java runtime environment (name/version);</li>
    <li>IP version;</li>
    <li>IP address (local/public);</li>
    <li>host name of computer;</li>
    <li>NAT and firewall status and data connection parameters;</li>
    <li>test time;</li>
    <li>test data transmitted.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>1.2.2.2. Processing of personal data and the purposes for processing of personal data </strong></h4>
<p>The following personal data is processed with explicit consent of the user in the course of the NDT-Test: the
    <strong>IP address</strong>.</p>
<p>Purposes for processing this personal data: technical implementation of the NDT-Test and data evaluation for a broad
    public.</p>
<h4><strong>1.2.2.3. Transferring of personal data</strong></h4>
<p>For the before mentioned purposes the IP address is transferred to the M-Lab research platform (<a
            href="http://www.measurementlab.net/" title="Link to M-Lab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.measurementlab.net</a>)
    in a third country. This means that this data is permanently stored by M-Lab, published as open data and made freely
    accessible to the general public for information, use, dissemination and other applications under M-Lab-Open Data.
    The privacy policy of M-Lab can be found under <a href="https://www.measurementlab.net/privacy" target="_blank"
                                                      rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.measurementlab.net/privacy</a>.
</p>
<p>Regarding M-Lab neither an adequacy decisions nor appropriate safeguards according to Art 46 GDPR exist. A possible
    risk of such a transfer is that the IP address of the user is transferred to M-Lab and published. Thus conclusions
    on the executing of the NDT-Test may be drawn. Eventually test results of the NDT-Test could be interlinked with the
    respective RMB-Tests and hence more information may be gained.</p>
<h2>1.3. Duration of storage of personal data </h2>
<p>The <strong>IP address</strong>, the <strong>WLAN network ID (SSID)</strong> and <strong>numerical WLAN ID
        (BSSID)</strong> are stored by RTR for a maximum period of six months. In any case the <strong>Client
        UUID</strong> will be deleted with the final termination of the RTR-NetTest.</p>
<h2>1.4. Rights of users in connection with personal data </h2>
<p>By providing the randomly generated client ID (= <strong>Client UUID</strong>)- which can be found in the app under
    Info - the user has amongst others the following rights concerning her or his personal data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>information;</li>
    <li>erasure, thus to withdraw her or his acceptance to the processing of her or his personal data at any time;</li>
    <li>lodging a complaint with the supervision authority (<a href="https://www.dsb.gv.at" target="_blank"
                                                               rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external-link">https://www.dsb.gv.at</a>);
    </li>
    <li>rectification;</li>
    <li>restriction;</li>
    <li>data portability.</li>
