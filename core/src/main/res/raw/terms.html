        <h1>1. Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2>1.1. General </h2>
        <p>The use of the RTR-NetTest app is only possible after explicit consent to RTR’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use for
            the RTR-NetTest. Under 14 years can use the RTR-NetTest with the consent of their legal guardian(s). Note that the
            IP address is transferred, among others, also to third countries (thus outside of the European Union, EU, and the
            European Economic Area, EEA) for which neither an adequacy decision nor appropriate safeguards exist. For further
            details see point 4.
        </p>
        <p>The RTR-NetTest informs users about the current service quality (including upload, download, ping, signal strength)
            of their Internet connection. For technically interested users RTR-NetTest provides two further options: On the one
            hand, RTR-NetTest offers a loop-mode, which enables automatically repeated RTR-NetTests; on the other hand, with
            the signal-only loop-mode signal measurements are also carried out repeatedly - without speed- or quality tests
            being carried out.

        <h2>1.2. Which data are processed?</h2>
        <h3>1.2.1. RTR-NetTest</h3>
        <p>The following data are processed as part of the <strong>RTR-NetTest</strong>:</p>
        <ul>

            for information, use, dissemination and other applications.</p>
        <p>Note: After consent to the privacy policy is given the authorization "Allow RTR-NetTest to start and manage calls"
            appears for devices that can have multiple SIM cards. This is specified by the operating system of the device. In
            the context of RTR-NetTest the identification of the SIM card, which is used for data traffic, is thus enabled. No
            other possible functions based on this authorization are used by RTR-NetTest. </p>
        <h3>1.2.2. Loop-mode option</h3>
        <p>
            The loop-mode option for technically interested users allows the automatic repetition of RTR-NetTest. The first
            test starts right after activation of the loop-modus; further tests are carried out when either the waiting time
            (default 30 minutes) has elapsed or the specified distance (default 250 meters) has been covered. Tests will be
            performed until the configured number of tests (default 10 tests) has been reached. The signal strength is measured
            continuously, also between two tests. The loop-modus can be stopped at any time respectively it stops after 48
            hours. It needs to be explicitly pointed out that due to the loop modus it cannot be excluded that the tester is
            identified.
        </p>
        <p>The same data as listed under 1.2.1 are processed.
            The data marked with * are published on the RTR-NetTest website and in the RTR-NetTest app and are made freely
            available to the general public as open data (<a href="https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata"

            for information, use, dissemination and other applications.</p>
        <h3>1.2.3. Signal-only loop-mode option</h3>
        <p>
            The signal-only loop-mode option for technically interested users allows the automatic repetition of signal
            measurements - without any speed- or quality tests being carried out. The signal-only loop-modus can be stopped at
            any time respectively it stops automatically after 48 hours. It needs to be explicitly pointed out that due to the
            signal-only loop modus it cannot be excluded that the tester is identified.
        </p>
        <p>The same data as listed under 1.2.1 are processed – with the exception that the latency of the data connection
            (ping), the connectivity on different ports, modifications of content, the transfer time for a reference web page,
            the background traffic volume, Domain Name System server queries, the traceroute, the VoIP test call are not tested
            and thus no data exist that could be processed.</p>

        <p>The transfer of data to Google, Cloudflare and Microsoft is based on adequacy decisions of the Commission - according
            to Art 45 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Regarding Quad9 neither an adequacy decisions nor appropriate
            safeguards according to Art 46 GDPR exist. A possible risk of such a transfer is that the IP address of the user is
            transferred to Quad9 and thus conclusions on the executing of RTR-NetTest may be drawn.</p>

        <h1>2. Terms of Use</h1>
        <p>Users use the browser version and app of the RTR-NetTest at their own risk. Please send any comments on correction of
            inaccurate content, graphics etc. by e-mail to <a href="mailto:netztest@rtr.at">netztest@rtr.at</a>. Under 14
            years can use the RTR-NetTest with the consent of their legal guardian(s).</p>
        <p>The RTR-NetTest informs users about the current service quality (including upload, download, ping, signal strength)
            of their Internet connection. The Android app features two options for technically interested users: On the one
            hand, RTR-NetTest offers a loop-modus, which enables automatically repeated RTR-NetTests (note: in pauses between
            the tests signal measurements continue); on the other hand, with the signal-only loop-modus signal measurements are
            also carried out repeatedly - without any speed- or quality tests. </p>
        <p>In the event of a great demand or very high number of tests in a specific area, the loop-modus can be rejected by the
            test system in order to avoid overload. Please note that the loop-modus is (only)
            intended for use within the EU and the EEA. The loop-modus consumes a large amount of data. With fast connections,
            10 tests can consume 1 GB or more of data. It is therefore strongly recommended that the loop-modus is only used
            with real flat rate tariffs, where additional data volume does not cause additional costs. The loop-modus drains the
            battery quickly. In pauses between the tests, the GPS and the display remain active and signal measurements
            continue, which means that the energy is used up much faster than during stand-by mode. The loop-modus should
            therefore only be used if an external power supply is available. The same applies to the signal-only loop-modus: The
            signal-only loop-modus is (only) intended for use within the EU and the EEA. The battery is quickly drained by the
            signal-only measurements. In the pauses between tests, the GPS and the display remain active and signal measurements
            continue, which means that the energy is used up much faster than in stand-by mode. The loop-modus should therefore
            only be used if an external power supply is available.</p>

        <p>RTR also points out that at the time of linking to third-party content on the World Wide Web (Internet links), this
            content was free of any illegal elements, and that RTR has no influence on the current and future form of the linked
            content. RTR explicitly renounces responsibility for any content of linked sites that were changed after the link
            was made. The accuracy of content is always the responsibility of the respective provider or operator of the
            website. RTR does not accept any liability and/or guarantee for it.</p>
        <p>There is no legal claim to permanent availability of the offer. RTR explicitly reserves the right to change, add to
            or delete parts of the RTR-NetTest or the entire RTR-NetTest offer without prior announcement, or to cease
            publication of it temporarily or finally.</p>
        <p>RTR makes every endeavour to ensure the RTR-NetTest browser version/website and RTR-NetTest app are constantly
            up-to-date, complete and accurate. To ensure the correctness of the results, implausible and/or obvious abusive
            measurements may be marked and/or removed by RTR. RTR reserves the right to initiate appropriate legal action in
            case of non-compliance. RTR accepts no liability for the up-to-dateness, correctness, completeness or quality of the
            information and offers provided. As a basic principle, no claims can be brought against RTR for material or
            immaterial disadvantages and/or losses resulting from the use or non-use of information provided or from the use of
            incorrect and incomplete information. Where RTR cannot assert a full waiver of liability due to the statutory
            provisions applicable in the individual case, liability shall be limited to gross negligence and malicious
            intent.</p>
